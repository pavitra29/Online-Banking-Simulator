<h2><br>Overview</h2>
<p>Mutual funds are funds that pool the money of several investors to invest in equity or debt markets. Mutual Funds could be Equity funds, Debt funds or balanced funds. Funds are selected on quantitative parameters like volatality, FAMA Model, risk adjusted returns, rolling return coupled with a qualitative analysis of fund performance and investment styles through regular interactions / due diligence processes with fund managers.
